# Yahtzee Simulation

Building a Yahtzee game in Python to test different playing strategies and see which ones work best.

## What we're doing

- Code up the basic Yahtzee game mechanics
- Make a few different strategies (greedy, probability-based, etc.)
- Run lots of simulated games 
- Compare results to find the best approach

Will add more as we build this out. Planning to keep the game logic, strategies, and simulation stuff in separate folders.
